# Crop Recommendation App 🌱🌾
The Crop Recommendation App is a handy tool designed to assist farmers in choosing the most suitable crops for their farms. 
It utilizes a machine learning model, specifically a RandomForestClassifier, to make crop recommendations based on various essential agricultural parameters.

## About 🌿
Crop recommendation plays a vital role in precision agriculture. 
It involves the selection of crops based on factors like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. 
The goal is to ensure that the recommendations are precise and accurate, as farming decisions have significant implications for material and capital resources.

## How it Works ❓
To determine the best crop for your farm, provide the following parameters:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature
Humidity (%)
pH level
Rainfall (in mm)

Once you've entered the necessary data, the machine learning model will predict the most suitable crops for your farm. 
Simply click the 'Predict' button, and the app will display the recommended crop.
